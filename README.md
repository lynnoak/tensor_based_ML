Metric learning algorithms for multi-relational data.
In metric learning algorithms, the metric of the data is very important. 
More specifically, our proposed metric learning method considers the characteristics of the observations and the relationships between the observations. 
And the learning of relational metrics is optimised based on the computation of 3D tensor.
